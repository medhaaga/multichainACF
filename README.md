# multichainACF
 The package calculates the Global Auto Covariance/Correlation Function (G-ACF) from Agarwal and Vats (2020). Given a list of multiple Markov chains, this package offers functions for ACF and CCF plots that pool information from all chains yielding more accurate estimates. The functions differs from the base `acf` and `ccf` by allowing the users to center the chains around the global mean from all Markov chains. A different mean argument can also be specified.
